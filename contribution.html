          <h2>Support</h2>
          <p>
            There are various ways you can support the museum. Donations are
            very welcome and are an important way we keep this museum open and
            accessible to the whole community. You can also support us by
            donating items of interest to the museum’s collections. If you have
            some item or collection that you think others would enjoy, please
            let us know by contacting our Collections Department and they will
            be able to assist you.

          <h2>Volunteer</h2>
          <p>
            A number of people volunteer their time and effort to keep the
            displays in good order and ready for visitors to come and enjoy.
            Volunteering has its perks including getting to see behind the
            scenes of a working museum, access to staff-only lectures, and a
            monthly lunch where all staff and volunteers come together to
            discuss ideas for future exhibits and strategies for the museum. You
            can help volunteer in a number of different spheres. Please contact
            us if you’d like to find out more about how you can get involved.
